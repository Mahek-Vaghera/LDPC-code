# LDPC Decoding for 5G NR 

This repository contains my project work for simulating LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) Decoding in the context of 5G NR. The simulation includes BPSK modulation, AWGN channel modeling, LDPC encoding/decoding, and performance evaluation.

ðŸ“‹ Project Description
The objective of this project is to:

Perform BPSK Modulation & AWGN Channel Simulation

Implement LDPC Soft Decision and Hard Decision Decoders

Evaluate Performance via Monte Carlo Simulations

The project uses the Base Graph 2 (BG2) for LDPC codes, following the 5G NR standard, with configurable lifting size and code rates.

ðŸ”§ Features
